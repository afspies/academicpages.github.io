Welcome to my personal page! I am a Research Fellow at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) under the guidance of [Prof. K Inuoe](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~inoue/official/content_e.html), and Ph.D. Candidate in CS at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), advised by [Prof. A. Russo](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/) and [Prof. M. Shanahan](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpsha/").

[My research](./publications.md) is focused on understanding Deep Learning models to improve safety and robustness. Recently I been most excited by approaches to reverse-engineer the internal representations of Large Language Models through the use of Mechanistic Intepretability techniques. To this end, I co-lead the [UnSearch](https://unsearch.org) Research Team, which aims to develop a systematic understanding of how/if transformers learn to represent goals, and to how they use "reason" with respect to their goals.

Alongside my research, I am also deeply passionate about [teaching](./teaching.html) - having contributed to the development and instruction of several courses at Imperial College London, most notably on 'Deep Learning' and 'Maths for Machine Learning'.

I previously completed an MSc in AI and ML at Imperial, and an MPhys in Physics with Theoretical Physics at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and I am happy to answer questions about these courses, and provide advice on applications (though it may take me a few weeks to respond).

<!-- # Before Contacting Me
I am not currently looking for full-time positions. However, I am always excited to discuss Ph.D. internship opportunites with a focus on Neurosymbolic and Object-Centric learning techniques. 

If you have questions about the **MSc in AI and ML** at Imperial, please see if these have been addressed in the [FAQ](/posts/2021/01/imperial-msc-faq) before reaching out to me.

I am more likely to respond to emails than LinkedIn requests. -->

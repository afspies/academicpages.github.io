Welcome to my personal page! I am currently in my final year as a Ph.D. candidate in CS at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), advised by [Prof. A. Russo](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/) and [Prof. M. Shanahan](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpsha/").

[My research](./publications.md) is focused on understanding Deep Learning models to improve their safety and robustness. Recently, I have been most excited by approaches to reverse-engineer the internal representations of Large Language Models through the use of Mechanistic Intepretability techniques. To this end, I co-lead the [UnSearch](https://unsearch.org) Research Team, which aims to develop a systematic understanding of how/if transformers learn to represent goals, and how they "reason" with respect to their goals.

Alongside my research, I am also deeply passionate about [teaching](./teaching.html) - having contributed to the development and instruction of several courses at Imperial College London, most notably those on 'Maths for Machine Learning' and 'Deep Learning'. I've also recently been working on some side projects including an [automated AI Safety Reading List](https://papers.unsearch.org), and a [sweeper for ML experiments](https://github.com/afspies/meinsweeper) on various kinds of nodes (SSH, Local etc.).

I recently completed a fantastic stay in Tokyo as a Research Fellow at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) under the guidance of [Prof. K Inoue](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~inoue/official/content_e.html). Prior to my Ph.D. I completed an MSc in AI and ML at Imperial, and an MPhys in Physics with Theoretical Physics at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I am happy to answer questions about these experiences, and to provide general advice on career progression and applications (though it may take me a few weeks to respond!).

<!-- # Before Contacting Me
I am not currently looking for full-time positions. However, I am always excited to discuss Ph.D. internship opportunites with a focus on Neurosymbolic and Object-Centric learning techniques. 

If you have questions about the **MSc in AI and ML** at Imperial, please see if these have been addressed in the [FAQ](/posts/2021/01/imperial-msc-faq) before reaching out to me.

I am more likely to respond to emails than LinkedIn requests. -->
